The **Rock, Paper, Scissors Showdown** project is an interactive game implemented in Python that simulates the classic hand game between a user and a computer. The game presents the user with three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, represented visually with ASCII art. 

Upon the user's input, the program randomly generates the computer's choice and displays both selections. It then compares the choices according to the traditional rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. The outcome is communicated to the user, indicating whether they won, lost, or drew the game.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and random number generation, while providing a fun and engaging way to practice coding skills.
